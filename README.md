## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

Non-random amount of variance are provided by vehicle weight, spoiler_angle & AWD.

2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

The slope or intercept of the multiple regression model is negative with a value of -1.04.

3. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

The multiple R-squared value is 0.7149 or 71%. This means the model will predict mpg value correctly 71% of the time. The adjusted R-Squared value of 0.6825 or 68% shows this conclusion is valid when other explanatory variables are taken into consideration.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

Lot 3 variance exceeded the specified 100 pounds per square inch while lot 1 and lot 2 are within the design requirements for the first 100 cases.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

Lot 1 and Lot 3 the PSI values are not different from the population mean. However lot 2 the p-value is .347 which means there is evidence that the suspension coil is different from the population mean. All t-tests can be seen below:
